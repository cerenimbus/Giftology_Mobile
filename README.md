# Giftology Demo (Expo)

This is a small demo mobile app built from Figma screen images you provided. It uses Expo + React Native and implements basic versions of the screens for a fast, demoable output.

Prereqs
- Node.js (14+)
- npm or yarn
- Expo CLI (optional)

Install

```powershell
cd c:\Users\Rentschler\Desktop\giftology
npm install
npm start
```

Then open in Expo Go or an emulator.

What's included
- `App.js` — navigation and entry
- `src/screens/*` — Login, Dashboard, Contacts, Feedback, Help, Forgot, Verify, Loading
- `assets/logo.png` — placeholder logo exported into the project

Notes
- The UI attempts to match the provided images visually with colors, spacing and rounded cards, but this is a quick demo. For pixel-perfect parity I'd pull typefaces and exact metrics from Figma.
- Let me know which screen to polish first and I can refine fonts, sizes, animations and add Storybook or tests.
